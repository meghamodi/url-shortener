### How URL Shortener Works?

1. The URL Shortener requests you to input a URL that you want shortened.
2. The server ingests the long URL and feeds it into a hash function to generate a hash.
3. The server sends the shortened URL to the user.
4. The user can copy the shortened URL and paste it into a new window.
5. VoilÃ ! You have the short URL redirecting to the original page.
